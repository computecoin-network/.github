**About OORT**

Founded in May 2021, OORT is a cloud platform for decentralized AI. Our network utilizes global resources ranging from data centers to edge devices, with a proprietary blockchain-based verification layer. OORT offers a suite of services, including data collection and labeling, data storage, and model training.
In other words, OORT proposes a new way of developing AI that’s open and transparent, involving key stages such as data collection and labeling, model training, and fine-tuning. Our goal is to democratize AI development, making it more inclusive and building trust through everyone's active participation.

**Our Products**

At OORT, we enable developers to build AI in a transparent, decentralized, and trustworthy way. We aim to democratize artificial intelligence so that its evolution reflects a broad range of perspectives. As of June 2024, OORT has served over 10 thousand enterprise and individual customers such as DELL, Lenovo Image and Binance Smart Chain.

**OORT Datahub**

It assists AI projects by collecting and labeling data provided by the global OORT community. Blockchain technology has been used to maintain an unambiguous, permanent record of every move in this process.

**OORT Storage**

Decentralized storage is achieved by combining global servers like Seagate, Tencent Cloud, and our own edge device Deimos. It works like Amazon AWS S3, but it’s 60% cheaper.

**OORT Compute**

The integration of geo-distributed GPUs makes them cost-effective for AI model training and inference. Coming in 2024.

**Olympus Protocol**

The Olympus Protocol is a proprietary blockchain technology of OORT that can be deployed by any party interested. The detailed technical description and performance are given in the <a href=https://oort-website.standard.us-east-1.oortech.com/OORT_Yellow_Paper.pdf>Yellow Paper</a>. Connecting all DePin devices globally across OORT, Olympus uses its specific proof of honesty (PoH) consensus algorithm that ensures each node works transparently and utilizes network resources optimally in a decentralized manner.
